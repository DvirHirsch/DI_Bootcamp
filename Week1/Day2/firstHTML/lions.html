				Present in Africa and India, the lion typically inhabits grasslands and
				savannahs, but is absent in dense forests. It is usually more diurnal
				than other big cats, but when persecuted adapts to being active at night
				and at twilight. A lion pride consists of a few adult males, related
				females and cubs. Prides vary in size and composition from three to 20
				adult lions, depending on habitat and prey availability. Females
				cooperate when hunting and prey mostly on large ungulates, including
				antelope, deer, buffalo, zebra and even giraffe.
